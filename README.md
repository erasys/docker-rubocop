## Developing

To update `Gemfile` or `Gemfile.lock`, we recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) in your host computer, and installing [`bundler`](http://bundler.io/) in this environment. `rbenv` should be able to pick up the `.ruby-version` file and then you can use `bundler` to change `Gemfile` or `Gemfile.lock`.
